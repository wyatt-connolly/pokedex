# :pencil: Lessons

Data fetching from an API and displaying that data in an orginized manner. That was the goal of this project. Most if not all projects that use React will have to fetch data at some point. That's just how web applications work. Yes, building a Pokedex is a cliche project, but it's a great project to learn how to data fetch. 

I learned how Next.js simplifies building web apps compared to create-react-app. SSR and SSG allows you to build a website based on what you want to build. Have a page that needs rendering 

I also dipped my hands into Tailwind for this project. After building the pokedex, I realized that I don't like the Tailwind approach. In my opinion, CSS should be seperated from JS. It makes the code unreadable and cramped. For small projects, Tailwind is alright because it streamlines writing CSS. But for big projects, I can't see myself using it. I would much prefer MUI, CSS modules or styled-components.
